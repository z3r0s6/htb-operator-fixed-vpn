> ## ⚡ This is a fixed fork
> Fork of [user0x1337/htb-operator](https://github.com/user0x1337/htb-operator) (v1.4.3) with VPN/IP fixes.
> See **[FIXES.md](FIXES.md)** for what changed.
>
> **Install (gives you the `htb-operator` command — no `python3` needed):**
> ```bash
> # From this folder:
> ./install.sh
> # or directly:
> pipx install --force .
> # or straight from GitHub (after you push it):
> pipx install --force git+https://github.com/z3r0s6/htb-operator-fixed-vpn
> ```
> Then use it (always add `--tcp` if your network blocks UDP):
> ```bash
> htb-operator machine start --id <ID> --update-hosts-file --start-vpn --tcp
> ```
> ⚠️ Do **not** run `pipx upgrade htb-operator` — it would replace this fixed build with the unfixed PyPI version. Re-run `./install.sh` if that happens.

HTB-Operator is developed and maintained by [user0x1337](https://github.com/user0x1337). It interacts with the [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) API, a popular cybersecurity training platform. Its primary goal is to save time when working with HTB.

<img alt="current version" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Under_Development-red">

# Restrictions on Windows
Windows has platform-specific limitations, so not all features are supported.
Unsupported features/commands:

- VPN start and stop

# Installation
HTB-Operator is written in Python. In general, it can run on any OS with Python installed. It has mainly been tested on Linux (Kali, Ubuntu) and currently has some limitations on Windows.

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment. Use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/) (which automatically creates an isolated Python environment) to install `htb-operator`:

```bash
pipx install htb-operator
```

# Configuration
You need an HTB API token:

1. Visit: [https://app.hackthebox.com/account-settings](https://app.hackthebox.com/account-settings)

2. Click **Create App Token**.
<img width="1465" height="181" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99e85feb-020c-4ffb-9f37-54f437d42a78" />

3. Create a token.
<img width="567" height="409" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69d3edbc-b66b-454c-a33f-7ec339177696" />

4. Store the token.
<img width="562" height="389" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78631296-fc5c-4de8-9f7a-df47a20b5482" />

5. Run:

```bash
htb-operator init -api YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

The API token (and other settings) is stored locally at:

- Linux: `$HOME/.config/htb-operator/config.ini`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\htb-operator\config.ini`

# Commands
The tool is command-based. You can use `-h` or `--help` at any level to display help information. The top-level commands are shown when you run the program without arguments:

```bash
htb-operator
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fbb1a80a-8005-40bd-86c6-ac3ff32dabf0)

# init
`init` should be the first command you run. As mentioned above, use it to register your API token:

```bash
htb-operator init -api YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5f3792b-46a8-4211-82dd-5aea5f516044)

`init` also supports an alternative HTB API URL. Use this only with caution and only if HTB changes the API URL.

# Info
The `info` command retrieves information for a user. If no user is specified, it shows information for the authenticated user.

```bash
htb-operator info
```

### `-s` / `--username`
Using `-s USERNAME` or `--username USERNAME`, you can display the profile of `USERNAME`. Example:

```bash
htb-operator info -s HTBBot
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a613234-4dce-4f41-8927-cf004c857cdb)

### `-a` / `--activity`
By default, activity is limited to the most recent 20 entries. Use `-a` or `--activity` to show the full activity history.

```bash
htb-operator info -a
```

`-s` / `--username` also works with this flag:

```bash
htb-operator info -a -s HTBBot
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/addda738-5435-4e66-9058-2efe81ca4a65)

# certificate
You can list or download earned certificates of completion.

### `-l` / `--list`
List all earned certificates of completion:

```bash
htb-operator certificate --list
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9fabf5d-cb2a-4663-812a-55cd030ff275)

### download
Using the `download` subcommand, you can download a certificate. With `--id`, specify the certificate ID (for example, from `--list`), and with `-f` / `--filename`, set the target path and filename.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8725d37a-32ea-4d2c-bc23-d90c184cec62)

# machine
The `machine` command provides subcommands to list machines, display details, and start, stop, or reset machines.

## list
Lists active and retired machines. You can add filter flags to optimize the output. See available flags with `htb-operator machine list -h`.

```bash
htb-operator machine list
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4ab1f19-d695-448c-816c-62268dc806eb)

Active machines that will be retired soon are marked as `✘/✔`.

### `--limit`
By default, the 20 most recent machines are shown. Use `--limit <NUMBER>` to change that value. Example:

```bash
htb-operator machine list --limit 10
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2ad559b-944a-470e-932a-429d8d93e6b3)

### `--retired`
If `--retired` is set, only retired machines are shown.

```bash
htb-operator machine list --retired
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da96ca5a-ff12-4bff-9edc-57319304f2ed)

### `--active`
If `--active` is set, only active machines are shown.

```bash
htb-operator machine list --active
```

### `--group-by-os`
Changes grouping of the result set. Instead of grouping by `Retired` and `Active`, output is grouped by OS.

```bash
htb-operator machine list --group-by-os
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1dcfbcde-c640-4281-849c-8e98bc48aa52)

## start
Starts an instance of a machine. If another machine is already running, you will be asked whether to stop it before starting the new one. Specify either `--id` or `--name`.

```bash
htb-operator machine start --id 620
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e13bdb3-e755-4a6a-9cee-b08b6884c56a)

### `--start-vpn`
If set, a VPN connection is established automatically based on the configured VPN server. This action requires **root/sudo/admin** permissions. On Linux, you will be prompted for your sudo password.

```bash
htb-operator machine start --id 620 --start-vpn
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2820fa16-0aa7-49fa-940e-09c0d9a67b38)

### `--update-hosts-file`
If set, the hosts file in `/etc/hosts` (Linux) or `/drivers/etc/hosts` (Windows, not tested) is updated. The machine hostname plus suffix `htb` (for example `HOSTNAME.htb`) and the assigned IP address are added. This action requires **root/sudo/admin** permissions. On Linux, you will be prompted for your sudo password.

```bash
htb-operator machine start --id 620 --update-hosts-file
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5399d44a-aaa5-4383-97fa-f4e90e00422b)

### `--wait-for-release`
Works only for scheduled machines. Starting is paused until the machine reaches its release date/time and is available to the full community. This is useful if you want to aim for first blood.

```bash
htb-operator machine start --id 620 --wait-for-release
```

### `--script <SCRIPT_FILE>`
Executes a custom Bash script after all prior steps are complete (for example, IP assignment and optional VPN setup). `htb-operator` sets these environment variables:

- `$HTB_MACHINE_IP` -> assigned IP
- `$HTB_MACHINE_NAME` -> machine name (for example `Sea`)
- `$HTB_MACHINE_OS` -> machine OS (`Linux`, `Windows`, `FreeBSD`, ...)
- `$HTB_MACHINE_DIFFICULTY` -> machine difficulty (for example `Easy`)
- `$HTB_MACHINE_INFO` -> information provided by HTB
- `$HTB_MACHINE_HOSTNAME` -> hostname (for example `sea.htb`)

#### Example
Example script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo "Starting script, assigned IP $HTB_MACHINE_IP and hostname $HTB_MACHINE_HOSTNAME"
nmap "$HTB_MACHINE_HOSTNAME" -p 80 --open
```

Command (flags can be combined for automation):

```bash
htb-operator machine start --id 620 --script /tmp/example.sh --start-vpn --update-hosts-file
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de741502-87af-407d-aa33-a3e856e1d3bd)

In this example, a warning appeared because a VPN connection was already running. This is informational and can usually be ignored.

## stop
Stops the currently active machine. 

```bash
htb-operator machine stop
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29a0a12b-3247-4594-ade6-7f8a4aff9067)

### `--stop-vpn`
Stops all running HTB VPN connections after stopping the machine. This action requires **root/sudo/admin** permissions. On Linux, you will be prompted for your sudo password.

```bash
htb-operator machine stop --stop-vpn
```

### `--clean-hosts-file`
Removes the hostname that matches the machine name from your hosts file. This action requires **root/sudo/admin** permissions. On Linux, you will be prompted for your sudo password.

```bash
htb-operator machine stop --clean-hosts-file
```

### Example
You can combine the `stop` flags shown above:

```bash
htb-operator machine stop --stop-vpn --clean-hosts-file
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57216405-e246-4c9c-8552-0bf8b289330e)

## reset
Resets the currently active machine.

```bash
htb-operator machine reset
```

### `--update-hosts-file`
Updates the hosts file, working exactly like `machine start --update-hosts-file`.

```bash
htb-operator machine reset --update-hosts-file
```

## extend
Extends the machine expiry time.

```bash
htb-operator machine extend
```

## status
Returns information about the currently active machine.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/242ad7e9-95e9-42f1-a0f4-dea5afa8b085)

## info
Displays detailed information about a machine specified via `--id` or `--name`.

```bash
htb-operator machine info --id 620
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d426e72d-b26a-46f8-b30e-2dd9a3d6dbd9)

## submit
Submits a flag for the active machine. Use `--user-flag` for the user flag and `--root-flag` for the root flag. You also need `-d` to rate difficulty (from `1` = `Piece of Cake` to `10` = `Brainfuck`).

```bash
htb-operator machine submit --user-flag <FLAG> -d <DIFFICULTY_RATING>
```

## ssh-grab
Establishes an SSH connection to the target host. It then attempts to read the flag from `/home/USERNAME/user.txt` (non-root) or `/root/root.txt` (root), and submits it to HTB for the currently active machine. You also need `-d` to provide a difficulty rating (from `1` = `Piece of Cake` to `10` = `Brainfuck`).

```bash
htb-operator machine ssh-grab -u <SSH-USERNAME> -p <SSH-PASSWORD> -i <TARGET_HOST> -d <DIFFICULT_RATING>
```

# challenge
The `challenge` command provides subcommands to list challenges, display details, download files/writeups, start challenge instances, and submit flags. Example: download files, unzip them, and start the instance with one command:

```bash
htb-operator challenge download --name "Hunting License" --unzip -s
```

## search
Use `search` to find challenges that contain the search term. `--name` is required.

```bash
htb-operator challenge search --name Spook
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/420f4564-b3d9-40ba-8ff6-f72ec7c54fe2)

### `--unsolved`
Shows only unsolved challenges. If both `--solved` and `--unsolved` are provided, unsolved challenges are returned.

### `--solved`
Shows only solved challenges. If both `--solved` and `--unsolved` are provided, unsolved challenges are returned.

### `--todo`
Shows only challenges with the `TODO` flag set.

### `--category`
Shows only challenges in the specified category. You can provide multiple categories separated by commas. Example:

```bash
htb-operator challenge search --name Spook --category Web,Crypto,Pwn
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1475a94a-7017-4101-b742-de0838c77eab)

### `--difficulty`
Shows only challenges that match the specified difficulty.

# Prolabs
The `prolabs` command provides subcommands to list all ProLabs and retrieve details for a specific ProLab.

## list
Lists all ProLabs.

```bash
htb-operator prolabs list
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f5a1514-5260-4845-bcc7-5eada511a8b1)

## info
Gets detailed information about a ProLab specified via `--id` or `--name`.

```bash

```

## reset-status
Show reset status and the timestamp of the last reset (if available).

```bash
htb-operator prolabs reset-status --name APTLabs
```

## submit
Use `submit` to submit ProLab flags. Example:

```bash
htb-operator prolabs submit --name "PROLAB" --flag 'HTB{FAKE_FLAG}'
```

# VPN
**Does not work on Windows.**

You can start and stop HTB VPN connections, view VPN status, download OpenVPN files, and run benchmarks against all or selected VPN servers.

## list
Lists VPN servers. You can filter, for example, by location or server type (labs, prolabs, etc.). Flags can be combined. Use the help command for details.

```bash
htb-operator vpn list --location US
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6344f4cb-c1d1-446d-990f-62979e8cf49d)
